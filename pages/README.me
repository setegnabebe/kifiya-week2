Analyze the basic metrics (mean, median, etc) in the Dataset (explain) & their importance for the global objective.
Conduct a Non-Graphical Univariate Analysis by computing dispersion parameters for each quantitative variable and provide useful interpretation. 
Conduct a Graphical Univariate Analysis by identifying the most suitable plotting options for each variable and interpret your findings.
Bivariate Analysis – explore the relationship between each application & the total DL+UL data using appropriate methods and interpret your result
Correlation Analysis – compute a correlation matrix for the following variables and interpret your findings: Social Media data, Google data, Email data, YouTube data, Netflix data, Gaming data, and Other data 
Dimensionality Reduction – perform a principal component analysis to reduce the dimensions of your data and provide a useful interpretation of the results (Provide your interpretation in four (4) bullet points maximum).
